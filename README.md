# Description
`replication_package_emese.R` is the R script used to create models and perform analysis.
Partially processed data is in the `data/` folder. Some files are raw data, processed to be split at 6 months; others are MAF/DAF-like measures (OSS and ISS) calculated on reply / call network matrices gathered from the raw data (processed form included).
